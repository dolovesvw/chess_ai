#
#    Ubuntu/Debian:
#    $ sudo apt-get install stockfish
#
#    Windows:
#    - Download from https://stockfishchess.org/download/
#    - Extract the executable to a known location
#    - Add to PATH or specify the path in the code
#
# 2. Verify installation:
#    $ stockfish --version
#
# 3. Install the Python dependencies:
#    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
